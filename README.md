- **Project 9**:  Large-scale Data Processing with Step Functions
  - **Description**: In this project, I implemented a large-scale data processing workflow using AWS Step Functions to orchestrate various tasks in a serverless architecture. The workflow utilized Amazon S3 for data storage, IAM for managing permissions, CloudWatch for monitoring and logging, and AWS X-Ray for tracing requests. 
  - **Service Used**:  AWS Step Functions, Amazon S3, IAM (Identity and Access Management), CloudWatch, AWS X-Ray

- **Project 13**:  Build an Automated Video Monitoring System with AWS IoT and AI/ML

  - **Description**: This project involved creating a real-time automated video monitoring system using AWS IoT and AI/ML services. By integrating AWS IoT Core for device communication and Amazon Rekognition for video analytics, I developed a solution that detects objects, faces, and events in video feeds. The system was further automated using AWS Lambda and CloudWatch to trigger responses based on the detected events, showcasing how IoT and AI/ML can streamline video surveillance processes for increased efficiency and security.

  - **Service Used**:  AWS IoT Core, Amazon Rekognition, AWS Lambda, Amazon CloudWatch, AWS IoT Greengrass, Amazon S3
